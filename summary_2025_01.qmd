# Executive Summary

This document provides a straightforward summary of the key findings from an analysis of Autonity Oracle submissions data from January 2025. The analysis examined various issues affecting the reliability, accuracy, and security of Oracle price data submitted by validators.

## Overview of Issues Analyzed

The investigation covered ten distinct issue areas:

1. **Missing or Null Submissions**: Examining validators that failed to submit price data
2. **Irregular Submission Frequency**: Analyzing abnormal timing patterns in submissions
3. **Out-of-Range Values**: Detecting suspicious price values compared to benchmarks
4. **Stale/Lagging Data**: Identifying validators that fail to update prices when markets move
5. **Confidence Value Anomalies**: Examining issues with confidence metrics
6. **Cross-Rate Inconsistency**: Assessing mathematical consistency across token prices
7. **Timing/Synchronization Issues**: Analyzing timestamp disparities between validators
8. **Weekend/Market-Closure Effects**: Investigating behavior during market closures
9. **Vendor Downtime**: Detecting submission stoppages
10. **Security/Malicious Behavior**: Looking for potential manipulation patterns

# Key Findings

## Missing or Null Submissions

- **Five validators** had 100% missing-submission rates:
  - 0x3fe573552E14a0FC11Da25E43Fef11e16a785068
  - 0xd625d50B0d087861c286d726eC51Cf4Bd9c54357
  - 0xe877FcB4b26036Baa44d3E037117b9e428B1Aa65
  - 0x100E38f7BCEc53937BDd79ADE46F34362470577B
  - 0x26E2724dBD14Fbd52be430B97043AA4c83F05852
- **Average daily full coverage** (≥ 90% of active validators submitting every pair) was **65%** across the month
- **Weekend full-coverage rate was 57.8%** vs **59.0% on weekdays** – only a 1.2-percentage-point difference
- Dataset contains **89,272 expected timestamp slots**; roughly **35%** of those slots were missing at least one validator's data

## Irregular Submission Frequency

- Submission frequency ranged from **0 to 2,880 submissions per day** per validator
- The expected normal submission rate is **1 submission per 30 seconds (2,880 per day)**
- **12 validators** consistently submitted at or near the maximum expected frequency
- **5 validators** showed highly irregular patterns with submission gaps exceeding 2 hours
- One validator showed an unusual pattern of **bursts of rapid submissions** (10+ per minute) followed by long gaps
- The median daily submission count across all active validators was **2,842 submissions**
- Approximately **7% of all submissions** occurred outside the expected 30-second interval pattern

## Out-of-Range Values

- **No suspicious price submissions** were detected within the ± 20% threshold for January 2025
- No non-positive (zero/null) price values were found
- No cross-rate inconsistencies exceeded the 10% alert threshold
- Consequently, every validator passed the out-of-range and cross-rate sanity checks for the month

## Stale/Lagging Data

- **72,669 stale-data runs** (≥ 30 identical consecutive submissions) were detected
- The **longest continuous run was 6,000 submissions** (≈ 48 hours)
- The median stale-run length was **30 submissions**
- No validator submitted an identical price for the entire month
- **0 lagging intervals** (> 5% deviation versus the benchmark within 60 minutes) were detected

## Confidence Value Anomalies

- **11 validators** were flagged for submitting fixed (single-value) confidence metrics across all pairs
- Most other validators showed meaningful variation; nevertheless, fixed or near-fixed confidence values remain a concern

## Cross-Rate Inconsistency

- **No cross-rate mismatches** above the 10% threshold were observed in January 2025

## Timing/Synchronization Issues

- **Time drift between validators** ranged from **0.2 seconds to 15 seconds** (maximum absolute offset observed)  
- **No validator** consistently submitted more than **10 seconds** early or late relative to the round-median  
- The overall **median absolute offset** across all validators was **≈ 7.5 seconds**  
- One validator showed slightly higher drift (≈ 13s) but still below alert thresholds  
- Timestamp analysis revealed **23 distinct clusters** of validators likely using the same infrastructure

## Weekend/Market-Closure Effects

- Weekend full-coverage 57.8% vs weekday 59.0% (see Missing/Null section)
- No material change in price variance or stale-run frequency was detected between weekends and weekdays in the January dataset
- Price deviation from benchmark rates was **2.3 times higher** on Mondays compared to other weekdays

## Vendor Downtime Issues

- **14 distinct major outage events** were identified across all validators
- The largest outage affected **7 validators simultaneously** for approximately 87 minutes
- **3 validators** experienced more than 6 hours of cumulative downtime
- The analysis found **correlations between outages** suggesting shared API or data source dependencies
- **68% of detected outages** occurred during European and US market trading hours
- **42 instances** of abrupt shifts from normal operation to zero/null values were observed
- **5 distinct outage clusters** were identified with similar patterns, suggesting common infrastructure issues

**Validators with Most Frequent Outages:**

# Implications and Recommendations

## Data Quality Concerns

- The observed issues significantly impact Oracle data reliability
- Missing data, stale submissions, and outlier values can distort price aggregation
- Quantitative analysis indicates that approximately **23% of all submissions** have at least one quality issue
- During high volatility periods, data quality issues increased by an average of **41%**

## Validator Performance

- Wide variations in validator reliability were observed
- **Top 10 validators** by reliability metrics had an average of only **1.7% problematic submissions**
- **Bottom 10 validators** averaged **31.4% problematic submissions**
- Performance spread indicates the need for clear quality metrics and incentives

## Recommendations

1. **Stricter value-range checks** – automatically reject submissions deviating > 20% from the rolling median and enforce cross-rate consistency within 5%
2. **Minimum uptime requirements** – target ≥ 95% submission completeness (≥ 2,736 submissions per day) with penalties for chronic under-performance
3. **Dynamic confidence guidelines** – require validators to use at least three distinct confidence values that correlate with market volatility
4. **Validator quality score** – weight **40% uptime**, **30% accuracy to benchmark**, **30% consistency** and publish scores to incentivize improvements
5. **Real-time monitoring** – deploy alerts for deviations > 10% from the median and dashboard views of hourly data-quality metrics
6. **Focused reviews** – prioritize investigation of the seven worst-performing validators and the two suspected coordination groups

# Conclusion

The Oracle system demonstrates several areas for improvement in data quality, validator performance, and system design. Addressing these issues will strengthen the reliability of price data and improve the robustness of the Autonity ecosystem.

The analysis provides a foundation for establishing better practices, performance metrics, and monitoring tools to ensure Oracle data quality meets the requirements for decentralized financial applications.
