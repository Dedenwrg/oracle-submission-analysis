# Executive Summary

This document provides a straightforward summary of the key findings from an analysis of Autonity Oracle submissions data from February 2025. The analysis examined various issues affecting the reliability, accuracy, and security of Oracle price data submitted by validators.

## Overview of Issues Analyzed

The investigation covered ten distinct issue areas:

1. **Missing or Null Submissions**: Examining validators that failed to submit price data
2. **Irregular Submission Frequency**: Analyzing abnormal timing patterns in submissions
3. **Out-of-Range Values**: Detecting suspicious price values compared to benchmarks
4. **Stale/Lagging Data**: Identifying validators that fail to update prices when markets move
5. **Confidence Value Anomalies**: Examining issues with confidence metrics
6. **Cross-Rate Inconsistency**: Assessing mathematical consistency across token prices
7. **Timing/Synchronization Issues**: Analyzing timestamp disparities between validators
8. **Weekend/Market-Closure Effects**: Investigating behavior during market closures
9. **Vendor Downtime**: Detecting submission stoppages
10. **Security/Malicious Behavior**: Looking for potential manipulation patterns

# Key Findings

## Missing or Null Submissions

- **Six validators** had 100% missing-submission rates:
  - 0x100E38f7BCEc53937BDd79ADE46F34362470577B
  - 0x3fe573552E14a0FC11Da25E43Fef11e16a785068
  - 0x26E2724dBD14Fbd52be430B97043AA4c83F05852
  - 0xc5B9d978715F081E226cb28bADB7Ba4cde5f9775
  - 0xd625d50B0d087861c286d726eC51Cf4Bd9c54357
  - 0x6747c02DE7eb2099265e55715Ba2E03e8563D051
- **Weekend coverage 11.9%** vs **weekday 17.9%**, indicating poorer weekend participation
- **≈ 85% of timestamps** had at least one missing validator
- **≈ 92,000 submission slots** analyzed; overall completeness **≈ 70.2%**

## Irregular Submission Frequency

- Daily counts ranged **0 – 2,880** (target 2,880)
- **11 validators** matched cadence all month; **7** had gaps > 2h
- Two displayed burst patterns (≥ 12 submissions/min) followed by long gaps
- Median daily count per active validator: **2,714**
- **≈ 9.3% of submissions** fell outside the 30-second cadence
- Intervals within a **±5% tolerance band** around the 30-second target (0.475–0.525 min) were counted as **on-schedule**

## Out-of-Range Values

- No suspicious price submissions were detected within the ± 20% threshold  
  - No non-positive (zero/null) price values were observed  
  - No cross-rate inconsistencies above the 10% threshold were found

## Stale/Lagging Data

- **57,984 stale-data runs** were detected. Each run is defined as **≥ 30 identical consecutive submissions** for a given price pair
- Several validators reached the maximum stale-score **6.0**, meaning they posted identical prices in **all six tracked pairs** for at least one timestamp

## Confidence Value Anomalies

- **428 validator-pair combinations** anomalous
- **47 validators** fixed confidence = 100 for Autonity pairs; **42** fixed (90/100) for FX
- **316 combinations** exhibited **zero variance**, indicating completely fixed confidence
- An *anomalous* combination here refers to either **zero variance** or a **correlation < 0.1** between confidence and price change
- Autonity pairs: **96.3%** fixed at 100; FX pairs: **81.7%** fixed at 90 or 100

## Cross-Rate Inconsistency

- No cross-rate inconsistencies exceeding the 10% threshold were detected in February 2025

## Timing/Synchronization Issues

- Drift ranged from **0.3s** (best) to **178s** (worst)
- **9 validators** averaged **> 10s early**, while **6** averaged **> 20s late** relative to the round median
- The fleet-wide **median absolute offset** was **5.8s**
- **27 timestamp clusters** were inferred, suggesting shared infrastructure; the largest contained **6 validators**

## Weekend/Market-Closure Effects

- Weekend vs weekday coverage –6 pp (11.9% vs 17.9%)
- FX variance **71% lower** on weekends; stale runs **53% higher**
- Participation –6.7% weekends; timing variance improved **32%**
- Monday benchmark deviation **2.8×** higher than other weekdays

## Vendor Downtime

- **19 major outages**; largest hit **9 validators** for **≈ 104 min**
- **4 validators** > 8h cumulative downtime
- **73%** outages during EU/US market hours; **57** zero/null events

# Implications and Recommendations

## Data Quality Concerns

- ≈ 27% of submissions held ≥ 1 quality issue; +48% during high volatility

## Validator Performance

- Top-10 validators: **1.5%** problematic submissions
- Bottom-10 validators: **37.8%** problematic submissions

## Recommendations

1. **Stricter value-range checks** – automatically reject submissions deviating > 20% from the rolling median and enforce cross-rate consistency within 5%
2. **Minimum uptime requirements** – target ≥ 95% submission completeness (≥ 2,736 submissions per day) with penalties for chronic under-performance
3. **Dynamic confidence guidelines** – require validators to use at least three distinct confidence values that correlate with market volatility
4. **Validator quality score** – weight **40% uptime**, **30% accuracy to benchmark**, **30% consistency** and publish scores to incentivize improvements
5. **Real-time monitoring** – deploy alerts for deviations > 10% from the median and dashboard views of hourly data-quality metrics
6. **Focused reviews** – prioritize investigation of problematic & coordinated validators

# Conclusion

Overall data quality deteriorated in February 2025, with notable declines in timing precision, weekend effects, vendor uptime, and security posture. However, Out-of-Range Values and Cross-Rate Consistency showed small improvements relative to January.
