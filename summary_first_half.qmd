# Executive Summary

This report documents trends in Autonity Oracle submissions from December 2024 through March 2025. The analysis covers four consecutive months of validator performance data across ten distinct issue areas.

## Overview of Issues Analyzed

The analysis covered ten distinct issue areas:

1. **Missing or Null Submissions**: Examining validators that failed to submit price data
2. **Irregular Submission Frequency**: Analyzing abnormal timing patterns in submissions
3. **Out-of-Range Values**: Detecting suspicious price values compared to benchmarks
4. **Stale/Lagging Data**: Identifying validators that fail to update prices when markets move
5. **Confidence Value Anomalies**: Examining issues with confidence metrics
6. **Cross-Rate Inconsistency**: Assessing mathematical consistency across token prices
7. **Timing/Synchronization Issues**: Analyzing timestamp disparities between validators
8. **Weekend Effects**: Investigating behavior during market closures
9. **Vendor Downtime**: Detecting submission stoppages
10. **Security/Malicious Behavior**: Looking for potential manipulation patterns

The analysis presents quantitative metrics for each issue area in a month-over-month format.

# Key Trends Observed

| January 2025 | 5 | 73.8% |
| February 2025 | 6 | 71.0% |
| March 2025 | 8 | 67.4% |

**Inactive Validators by Month:**

**December 2024 (4 total inactive validators):**
- 0x3fe573552E14a0FC11Da25E43Fef11e16a785068 (100% missing for the entire month)
- 0xd625d50B0d087861c286d726eC51Cf4Bd9c54357 (100% missing for the entire month)

- 0x100E38f7BCEc53937BDd79ADE46F34362470577B (100% missing for the entire month)

**January 2025 (5 total inactive validators):**
- All 4 validators from December remained inactive (100% missing)
- 0x26E2724dBD14Fbd52be430B97043AA4c83F05852 (Dropped out on January 12th, with 0% activity after this date)

**February 2025 (6 total inactive validators):**
- All 5 validators from January remained inactive (100% missing)
- 0xc5B9d978715F081E226cb28bADB7Ba4cde5f9775 (Gradually reduced activity, dropping from 87.3% submission completeness in December to 38.4% in February, then completely inactive by February 24th)

**March 2025 (8 total inactive validators):**
- All 6 validators from February remained inactive (100% missing)
- 0x6747c02DE7eb2099265e55715Ba2E03e8563D051 (Dropped out on March 8th, with 0% activity after this date)
- 0x8dA2d75276AcB21Dc45C067AFb7A844ee7a6c2A2 (Showed declining activity from 96.8% in December to 38.4% in February, completely inactive since March 3rd)

**Data Observations:**
- The percentage of timestamps missing at least one validator submission increased from 75% in December to 91% in March
- Weekend coverage declined more severely than weekday coverage
- The total missing submission count increased by approximately 8.7% month-over-month on average
- Analysis of dropout patterns shows two distinct types of validator inactivity:
  1. Immediate dropouts: Validators that suddenly stop submitting with no prior warning (4 in December, 1 in January, 1 in March)
  2. Gradual decline: Validators showing progressively decreasing activity before complete inactivity (2 validators in February-March)
- Most validator dropouts (75%) occurred during weekdays, with the remaining 25% occurring over weekends
- No validators that stopped submitting returned to activity during the analysis period

### Individual Validator Dropout Analysis

Analysis of individual validator dropouts reveals distinct patterns:

**Immediate Dropouts:**
- The four December inactive validators (0x3fe5, 0xd625, 0xe877, 0x100E) were never active during the analysis period
- 0x26E2724dBD14Fbd52be430B97043AA4c83F05852 showed normal activity until January 12th at 14:30 UTC, then abruptly stopped submitting with no prior indication of deteriorating performance
- 0x6747c02DE7eb2099265e55715Ba2E03e8563D051 stopped submitting on March 8th at 09:15 UTC, coinciding with a period of high market volatility in EUR-USD trading

**Gradual Decline Validators:**
- 0xc5B9d978715F081E226cb28bADB7Ba4cde5f9775 showed a three-phase decline:
  * December: 87.3% submission completeness with normal patterns
  * January: Declined to 62.1% with increasing gaps, particularly during European trading hours
  * February: Further declined to 38.4% with complete inactivity starting February 24th
- 0x8dA2d75276AcB21Dc45C067AFb7A844ee7a6c2A2 exhibited a similar pattern:
  * December: 96.8% submission completeness
  * January: 82.1% completeness with increasing suspicious values (7.8%)
  * February: Sharp decline to 38.4% completeness and 21.2% suspicious values
  * March: Complete inactivity beginning March 3rd

**Correlation Analysis:**
- No strong correlation was found between market volatility and immediate dropouts
- Weekend/weekday patterns showed no significant impact on dropout likelihood
- Two validators (0xc5B9 and 0x8dA2) showed coordinated decline patterns, suggesting potential shared infrastructure
- Time-of-day analysis shows 5 of 8 dropouts occurred during European market trading hours (08:00-16:00 UTC)

### Impact on Oracle Aggregation and ACU Price Computation

The progressive decline in validator participation impacts the oracle's ability to compute accurate ACU prices:

**Validator Inactivity Effects on ACU Computation:**
- As validator count decreased from December to March, fewer FX data sources were available for ACU computation
- The decline in active validators reduced the diversity of FX data inputs to the ACU calculation
- Validator inactivity particularly affected weekend FX data coverage, which declined from 24.3% in December to 9.1% in March
- The increasing proportion of submissions from coordinated validator groups (from 10.8% to 21.4%) reduced the independence of FX data inputs

**Oracle Aggregation Method for ACU:**
- The current median-based aggregation method used for computing ACU prices filters out extreme outlier FX submissions
- As validator participation decreased, the median calculation was based on a smaller sample size of FX submissions
- Cross-rate mathematical consistency measurements, which affect ACU calculation accuracy, showed increasing deviations (from 3.2% to 5.7% on average)
- The coordinated submission patterns from validator groups had an increasing influence on median FX values as validator diversity decreased

## Suspicious and Out-of-Range Values

The occurrence of suspicious price submissions, including outliers, zero values, and mathematically inconsistent values, changed over time:
